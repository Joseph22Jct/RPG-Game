# RPG-Game
I Started this RPG as a means to get into Unity, so a lot of it is spaghetti code that I am not very proud of, however, there was some work done with UI I do like
visually, as well as management of inventories and even a dynamic shader I made that creates a pleasant color palette from any color.

I would love to revisit this idea in the future, but as it is now, I abandon this project and I appreciate what I learned from it.
